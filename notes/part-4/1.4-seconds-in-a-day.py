## Please write a program which asks the user for a number of days. The program then prints out the number of seconds in the amount of days given.

# The program should function as follows:

## Sample output
# How many days? -> input: '1'
# Seconds in that many days: 86400

# Another example:

## Sample output
# How many days? -> input: '7'
# Seconds in that many days: 604800


## Solution:
days = int(input("How many days?"))
print(f"Seconds in that many days: {days*24*60*60}")
