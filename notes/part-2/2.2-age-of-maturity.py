## Please write a program which asks the user for their age.
# The program should then print out a message based on whether the user is of age or not, using 18 as the age of maturity.

# Some examples of expected behaviour:

## Sample output
# How old are you? -> input: '12'
# You are not of age!

## Sample output
# How old are you? -> input: '32'
# You are of age!


## Solution:
age = int(input("How old are you?"))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are of age!")
else:
    print("You are not of age!")
