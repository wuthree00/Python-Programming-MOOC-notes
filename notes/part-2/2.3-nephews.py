## Please write a program which asks for the user's name. If the name is Huey, Dewey or Louie,
## the program should recognise the user as one of Donald Duck's nephews.

# In a similar fashion, if the name is Morty or Ferdie,
# the program should recognise the user as one of Mickey Mouse's nephews.

# Some examples:

## Sample output
# Please type in your name: -> input: 'Morty'
# I think you might be one of Mickey Mouse's nephews.

Sample output
# Please type in your name: -> input: 'Huey'
# I think you might be one of Donald Duck's nephews.

Sample output
# Please type in your name: -> input: 'Ken'
# You're not a nephew of any character I know of.


## Solution:
name = input("Please type in your name:")
if name == "Morty" or name == "Ferdie":
    print("I think you might be one of Mickey Mouse's nephews.")
elif name == "Huey" or name == "Dewey" or name == "Louie":
    print("I think you might be one of Donald Duck's nephews.")
else:
    print("You're not a nephew of any character I know of.")
