## Please write a program which asks for the user's age. If the age is not plausible, that is,
## it is under 5 or something that can't be an actual human age, the program should print out a comment.

# Have a look at the examples of expected behaviour below to figure out which comment is applicable in each case.

## Sample output
# What is your age? -> input: '13'
# Ok, you're 13 years old

## Sample output
# What is your age? -> input: '2'
# I suspect you can't write quite yet...

## Sample output
# What is your age? -> input: '-4'
# That must be a mistake


## Solution:
age = int(input("What is your age?"))
if age >= 5:
    print(f"Ok, you're {age} years old")
elif 0 <= age < 5:
    print("I suspect you can't write quite yet...")
else:
    print("That must be a mistake")
