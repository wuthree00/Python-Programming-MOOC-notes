## The function len can be used to find out the length of a string, among other things.
## The function returns the number of characters in a string.

# Some examples of how this works:

  # word = "abcd"
  # print(len(word))

  # print(len("hi there"))

  # word2 = "howdydoody"
  # length = len(word2)
  # print(length)

  # empty_string = ""
  # length = len(empty_string)
  # print(length)

## Sample output
# 4
# 8
# 10
# 0

# Please write a program which asks the user for a word and then prints out the number of characters, if there was more than one typed in.

# Examples of expected behaviour:

## Sample output
# Please type in a word: -> input: 'hey'
# There are 3 letters in the word hey
# Thank you!

## Sample output
# Please type in a word: -> input: 'banana'
# There are 6 letters in the word banana
# Thank you!

## Sample output
# Please type in a word: -> input: 'b'
# Thank you!


## Solution:
word = input("Please type in a word:")
length = len(word)
if length > 1:
    print(f"There are {length} letters in the word {word}")
print("Thank you!")
