## This program calculates the end of year bonus a customer receives on their loyalty card.
## The bonus is calculated with the following formula:

  # If there are less than a hundred points on the card, the bonus is 10 %
  # In any other case the bonus is 15 %
  # The program should work like this:

## Sample output
# How many points are on your card? -> input: '55'
# Your bonus is 10 %
# You now have 60.5 points

# But there is a problem with the program, so with some inputs it doesn't work quite right:

## Sample output
# How many points are on your card? -> input: '95
# Your bonus is 10 %
# Your bonus is 15 %
# You now have 120.175 points

# Please fix the program so that there is always either a 10 % or a 15 % bonus, but never both.


## Solution:
points = int(input("How many points are on your card? "))
if points < 100:
    points *= 1.1
    print("Your bonus is 10 %")

elif points >= 100:
    points *= 1.15
    print("Your bonus is 15 %")

print(f"You now have, {float(points)}, points")
