## Please write a program which asks for the number of students on a course and the desired group size.
## The program will then print out the number of groups formed from the students on the course.
## If the division is not even, one of the groups may have fewer members than specified.

# If you can't get your code working as expected, it is absolutely okay to move on and come back to this exercise later.
# The topic of the next section is conditional statements. This exercise can also be solved using a conditional construction.

## Sample output
# How many students on the course? -> input: '8'
# Desired group size? -> input: '4'
# Number of groups formed: 2

## Sample output
# How many students on the course? -> input: '11'
# Desired group size? -> input: '3'
# Number of groups formed: 4

# Hint: the integer division operator // could come in handy here.


## Solution:
students = int(input("How many students on the course?"))
size = int(input("Desired group size?"))
if students % size == 0:
    print(f"Number of groups formed: {students//size}")

if students % size !=0 :
    print(f"Number of groups formed: {students//size+1}")
