## Please write a program which asks the user for an integer number.
# If the number is less than zero, the program should print out the number multiplied by -1.
# Otherwise the program prints out the number as is.
# Please have a look at the examples of expected behaviour below.

## Sample output
# Please type in a number: -> input: '-7'
# The absolute value of this number is 7

## Sample output
# Please type in a number: -> input: '1'
# The absolute value of this number is 1

## Sample output
# Please type in a number: -> input: '-99'
# The absolute value of this number is 99


## Solution:
number = int(input("Please type in a number:"))
if number < 0:
    number = number*-1

print(f"The absolute value of this number is {number}")
