## Thus far, you have probably used double quotation marks " to print out strings. In addition to the double quotation marks, Python also accepts single quotation marks '.

## This comes in handy if you ever want to print out the actual quotation marks themselves:
# print('"Come right back!", shouted the police officer.')

## Sample output:
# "Come right back!", shouted the police officer.

# Please write a program which prints out the following:
# print("Hello there!")


## Solution:
print('print("Hello there!")')
